## Research Question â€“ What impact does workout session duration for members of the gym have on their body fat percentage, and how can a regression model be used as supporting evidence to encourage members of the public to prioritise their activity levels?

### Executive Summary
A simple linear regression model was run on the gym_members_exercise-tracking.csv dataset (sourced from Kaggle.com) to assess how weekly workout session duration (in hours) affects the body fat percentage of members. Body fat % was the dependent variable and weekly gym duration was the independent variable. 

The results show that workout duration does have an impact on body fat %, as does water intake. Based on this linear regression analysis, increasing weekly workout duration by one hour is associated with a 1.65% decrease in body fat percentage. Therefore, it can be recommended to incorporate an additional hour of exercise into weekly routines to help reduce body fat. 

The analysis also suggests drinking more water can aid in reducing body fat, so an extra litre a day alongside increased workout duration may have an even larger impact.

The model can be rerun on real data and insights can be used to produce factual statistics around the small changes people can make to better get in shape. This will provide benefit to communities who require more of a focus on preventative care, saving healthcare organisations time and money, boosting gym membership uptake all whilst improving quality of life for individuals.

### Project Background
The gym members dataset presents 973 rows of data, each one detailing information about different members of the gym. The data collected around these members is as follows:

Age

Gender

Weight (kg)

Height (m)

Max_BPM

Resting_BPM

Session_Duration (hours)

Calories_Burned  

Workout_Type

Fat_Percentage

Water_Intake (liters)

Workout_Frequency (days/week)

Experience_Level

BMI

The insights taken from the results of the analysis may be useful in informing members of the public how impactful gym sessions can be on body fat %. Although this dataset is an open one and accessible at Kaggle.com (Gym Members Exercise Dataset, no date), it may be a great way to promote active lifestyle changes in members of the community. There is a potential opportunity to share statistics that may encourage people to join their local gym for their general health.

### Process
The first step is to download the dataset and do some initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on it. This includes assessing the data quality and visualising pairs of variables that could show potential correlation.
